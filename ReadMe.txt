I've wrapped up my project, and I'm excited to share it with you! I used React and Vite for the tech stuff, making everything smooth and snappy.
The project looks cool, thanks to Tailwind CSS giving it a stylish touch.

The Tech stack I have used over there is 
1.React + Vite
2. Tailwind Css
3. Some Packages like Swipper.js, React-scroll




You can simply run the project by installing npm and following commands :

1. Extract the ZIP file
2. Install NPM by "npm i or npm install"
3. And the final command "npm run dev"
